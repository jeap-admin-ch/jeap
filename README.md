# jEAP - Java Enterprise Application Platform

Welcome to the **Java Enterprise Application Platform (jEAP)** umbrella repository. jEAP provides a suite of
libraries and tools designed to assist in developing Java-based software applications based on Spring Boot.
Each jEAP repository addresses specific cross-functional needs, including but not limited to logging, monitoring,
messaging, security and encryption.

## Purpose

The jEAP suite provides developers with a set of ready-to-use solutions for common challenges when developing enterprise
applications using Spring Boot. Building on the blueprint provided by jEAP allows you to focus on business logic and
functionality, with jEAP providing solutions for the reusable cross-functional aspects.

## Getting Started

This umbrella repository is a guide to the individual components of the jEAP suite. We recommend exploring each
repository to understand how it can be applied to your projects.

## Building jEAP

To build jEAP libraries from source, you will usually be able to start a build using the provided Apache Maven Wrapper
script in the repository. The following command will build the project, run all tests and install the library
in your local Apache Maven repository:

```shell
./mvnw install
```
Note that jEAP libraries may have additional build requirements, such as specific Java versions. Please refer to the
individual repository's README.md or pom.xml for more information.

### Confluent Maven Repository

jeap-messaging libraries that serialize/deserialize Kafka records using a Confluent Avro Schema Registry require 
dependencies from the Confluent Maven Repository. To build these libraries, you need to configure the Confluent 
repository either in your Maven settings.xml or locally in the repository's pom.xml. For more information, please refer 
to the [Maven documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html) and the
[Confluent Java Client documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-clients/java/current/overview.html#java-installation).

```xml
<repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>confluent</id>
            <url>https://packages.confluent.io/maven/</url>
        </repository>
